# Configuring virt-who with vSphere to Report Hypervisor Host Information to the Red Hat Customer Portal

In this tutorial we will look at configuring virt-who to provide vSphere hypervisor host information when the RHEL VM is registered to the customer portal.

For this tutorial I created a small RHEL VM (1 vCPU wth 2 GB RAM) running on VMWare to host the virt-who daemon.

I registered the system with the activation key to Red Hat customer portal.  **Note:** I have Simple Content Access enabled on my Red Hat customer portal.

```
# subscription-manager register --org=xxxxxxxxx --activationkey=your_key_here
```
 
 I checked to make sure that the RHEL 8 repos are enabled on the VM.
```
# subscription-manager repos --list-enabled
+----------------------------------------------------------+
    Available Repositories in /etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo

Repo ID:   rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-rpms
Repo Name: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 for x86_64 - AppStream (RPMs)
Repo URL:  https://cdn.redhat.com/content/dist/rhel8/$releasever/x86_64/appstream/os

Repo Name: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 for x86_64 - BaseOS (RPMs)

```

Check to see if virt-who is installed.
```
# rpm -qa virt-who
```

If virt-who is not installed, let's install it.
```
# yum -y install virt-who
...
Complete!
```

The virt-who installation creates template configuration file that we can use to setup virt-who for environment.  The template configuration file is located under the /etc/virt-who.d/ directory.  


We will create the virt-who.conf file. Before edting the file we need the organzation id under which the RHEL VM is registered. 
```
# subscription-manager identity
system identity: 2278e9a5-90d2-41d3-ba51-2b605607f2ba
name: virt-who.example.com
org name: #######
org ID: #######
```

The vCenter user ID needs read-only access to all objects in the vCenter.  I created a user ID named 'virt-who' on my vCenter and gave it read-only access.

Now create and edit the virt-who.conf file.  This configuration file is self-explanatory.  The hypervisor_id setting is a default setting we need in the configuration file.  
```
# vi virt-who.conf
[vmware]
type=esx
server=vsca01.example.com
username=virt-who@vsphere.local
password=password
owner=#######
hypervisor_id=hostname
```
If you have more than one vCenter, simply create as many sections in the configuration file to match the number of vCenters.
```
[vcenter01]
type=esx
server=vsca01.example.com
username=virt-who@vsphere.local
password=password
owner=#######
hypervisor_id=hostname

[vcenter02]
type=esx
server=vsca02.example.com
username=virt-who@vsphere.local
password=password
owner=#######
hypervisor_id=hostname
```

Before starting virt-who you manually test the configuration.
```
# virt-who --print
```

For an easier readout of the configuration test, try the following command.
```
# virt-who --print | jq
```

Let's start the virt-who daemon.
```
# systemctl start virt-who
```

Let's check the status virt-who
```
# systemctl status virt-who
```

Make virt-who startup automatically when the server is rebooted.
```
# systemctl enable virt-who
Created symlink /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/virt-who.service â†’ /usr/lib/systemd/system/virt-who.service.
```

Let's encrypt the password contained in the virt-who.conf file.

To do that run the virt-who-password command and supply the vCenter password.
```
virt-who-password
Password: 
Use following as value for encrypted_password key in the configuration file:
14809...98a885d4cecd
```

Change your virt-who.conf file to the following.
```
# vi virt-who.conf
[vmware]
type=esx
server=vsca01.example.com
username=virt-who@vsphere.local
encrypted_password=14809...98a885d4cecd
owner=#######
hypervisor_id=hostname
```

You can test this new configuration using the same command above.  Remember to restart the virt-who daemon.
```
# systemctl restart virt-who
```
